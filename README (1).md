# Recipe Sharing Website Assignment

## Objective
Build a basic webpage to share your favorite recipe, which will include ingredients, preparation steps, and images.

## Tools Required
- Git Bash
- Any text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- Web browser

## Instructions

### Project Initialization
1. Open Git Bash.
2. Navigate to your preferred project directory.
3. Create a new directory called `assignment_1` using `mkdir assignment_1`.
4. Change into the `assignment_1` directory with `cd assignment_1`.

### File Creation
1. Within the `assignment_1` directory, use the `touch` command to create an `index.html` file.

### Version Control
1. Initialize a Git repository using `git init`.
2. Link your local repository to the remote repository using `git remote add origin git@github.com:pwolfeUMHB/Simple-Recipe-Sharing-Website.git`.
3. Confirm the creation of your `index.html` file with `git status`.

### Create and Checkout a New Branch
1. Create a new branch for your assignment using `git branch assignment_1`.
2. Switch to your new branch with `git checkout assignment_1`.

### Page Structure
1. Open `index.html` in your text editor.
2. Code the HTML document structure with the necessary doctype, html, head, and body tags.
3. Add a meaningful title to your page within the head section.

### Content Creation
1. In the body, create:
   - A header (`<header>`) with the name of your recipe.
   - A navigation bar (`<nav>`) with links to the recipe sections.
   - A main content area (`<main>`) with sections for Ingredients, Preparation, and Gallery.
   - A footer (`<footer>`) with copyright information and a placeholder link for recipe submissions.

### Basic Styling
1. Apply inline CSS to add basic styling to your webpage.

### Commit to Git
1. Save your changes in the text editor.
2. Add your files to the staging area with `git add .`.
3. Commit your changes to the branch with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "Complete recipe sharing webpage"`.

### Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository
1. Push your branch to the GitHub repository using `git push -u origin assignment_1`.
2. Verify that your branch has been pushed to the remote repository by checking on GitHub.

### Testing
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to test how your webpage looks.
2. Make any necessary changes to ensure the webpage looks clean and is easy to navigate.

## Deliverables
- A complete `index.html` file with the specified content and structure.
- Screenshots of your webpage and Git Bash with your commit history.

## Submission
- Push your repository to a remote service like GitHub and provide the link.
- Submit all deliverables according to your instructor's guidelines.

Good luck, and happy coding!
